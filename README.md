# FEAST Website

As of now (2019), each of the years will live in a subdirectory based on the year (starting with 2018).

For next year, create a 2020 directory, copy the necessary files over from 2019, and update the `meta` refresh in [index.html](index.html) to point to `./2020/index.html`.

This will allow all future links to work and not break every year.
